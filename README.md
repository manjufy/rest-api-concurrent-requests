# Rest API Demo With Concurrent Requests

API is implemented in NodeJS using express

In this repo, we are going to demonstrate the use of handling multiple requests of the same payload and how we can make sure to avoid duplicate creation of the same resource.

# How to run

Make sure to have node installed

`npm install -g nodemon` => Make sure to install this globally.

`git clone <repo>` from Github

`> npm i`

`> npm run dev`

Go to Postman or any http client tool and try to perform the following request multiple times

POST http://localhost:3000/api/users
{
	"full_name": "Micheal Schumacher",
	"username": "usermame",
	"password": "ferrari",
	"email":"micheal",
	"passport_number": "Z34343434",
	"phone": "2323232323",
	"country": "Germany"
}

In the database we should have only one entry for the above user and rest of them should be ignore.
How we manage with ignored calls its left upto us. Either we can log them or store them in another table for auditing.

The concurrent rest calls are also demonstrated in the e2e tests. Check out `test/e2e/users.js` file.

## Tests

### End-to-end (e2e) Tests

Make sure to install mochal globablly `npm install mocha -g`

Make sure to update DB settings in config (https://github.com/manjufy/api-e2e-testing/blob/master/config.js)

Make sure to create a database named `kljs-e2e-test` before running e2e tests.

`> npm run test:e2e`
